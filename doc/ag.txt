*ag.txt*   Plugin that integrates ag with Vim

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                               *ag*

This plugin is a front for the_silver_searcher: ag. Ag can be used as a
replacement for ack. This plugin will allow you to run ag from vim, and shows
the results in a split window.

:Ag[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Ag*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:[N]Agg [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                      *:Agg* *:AgGroup*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
      ag --group --column
    shell command, but will open a temporary buffer for you. If [N] is given
    N lines of context are surrounded from match.
    On this buffer (unmodifiable) you have highlights for filename,
    linenumber, surround lines and search string. Even folds for file matches
    and this mappings avaliable:

     o       fold/unfold current file match
     O       fold/unfold all matches
     <Enter> Goto selected file:line:col
     <space> Open next fold search (cyclic)
     s       Goto selected file:line:col splitting horizontal above
     S       Goto selected file:line:col splitting vertical above
     d       Delete result
     gl       Toggle linenumber visualization

                                                        *:AggFile* *:AgGroupFile*
:[N]AggFile {fileregexp} [options] {pattern} [{directory}]

    Search like |Agg|, but uses first word as fileregexp for -G option of ag.

:AgBuffer[!] [options] {pattern}                                    *:AgBuffer*

    Search for {pattern} in all open buffers. Behaves just like the |:grep|
    command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given
    the first error is jumped to.

    Note: this will not find changes in modified buffers, since ag can only
    find what is on disk! You can save buffers automatically when searching
    with the 'autowrite' option. A buffer will be ignored if it is a directory
    (an explorer, like netrw).

:AgAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:AgAdd*

    Just like |:Ag|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:AgFromSearch [{directory}]                                     *:AgFromSearch*

    Just like |:Ag| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LAg [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                   *:LAg*

    Just like |:Ag| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LAgBuffer [options] {pattern}                                     *:LAgBuffer*

    Just like |:AgBuffer| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are
    placed in the current |location-list|.

:LAgAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                             *:LAgAdd*

    Just like |:AgAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:AgFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                             *:AgFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:AgHelp[!] [options] {pattern}                                        *:AgHelp*

    Search vim documentation files for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
    |:Ag| command, but searches only vim documentation .txt files

:LAgHelp [options] {pattern}                                 *:LAgHelp*

    Just like |:AgHelp| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed
    in the current |location-list|.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence. <Enter> on a
line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                            *ag-options*

To change options, create empty dict beforehand and specify them one-by-one:
  let g:ag = {}
  let g:ag.opt1 = val1
  ...

Or you can specify desired options all at once
  let g:ag = {'opt1': 'val1', ...}

Skipped options will be filled by default values from |autoload/ag/opts.vim|.

                                                                     *g:ag.prg*
The location of the Ag program, and any options you want passed to it before
searching. Default: "ag --vimgrep" (for parsable output). Example: >
  let g:ag.prg="ag --vimgrep --smart-case"
<
Note: the `--vimgrep` option was added in Ag 0.25.0. If ag.vim detects that
you're using a lower version, the following default will be used instead: >
  let g:ag.prg="ag --column --nogroup --noheading"
<
This works around inconsistent behaviors in earlier Ag versions, but it is
recommended that you upgrade if possible for a better experience. `--vimgrep`
supports multiple matches on the same line of text, for example.

For background, see: https://github.com/rking/ag.vim/pull/88

                                                       *g:ag.working_path_mode*
A mapping that describes where ag will be run. Default is the current working
directory. Specifying 'r' as the argument will tell it to run from the project
rootdirectory. For now any other mapping will result to the default.
Example:
  let g:ag.working_path_mode='r'

                                                               *g:ag.highlight*
If 1, highlight the search terms after searching. Default: 0. Example: >
  let g:ag.highlight=1
<

                                                                  *g:ag.format*
Format to recognize the matches. See 'errorformat' for more info. Default:
"%f" when searching for files, "%f:%l:%c:%m" if not otherwise set. For
example, if your `g:ag.prg` is set to just "ag" (no column numbers in the
output, so when you jump to a match your cursor will be on the start of the
line): >
  let g:ag.format="%f:%l:%m"
<

                                                         *g:ag.apply_lmappings*
Whether or not to add custom mappings to location list windows opened by this
plugin. Only applies if you're using the location list. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:ag.apply_lmappings=0
<

                                                         *g:ag.apply_qmappings*
Whether or not to add custom mappings to quickfix windows opened by this
plugin. Only applies if you're using the error list. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:ag.apply_qmappings=0
<

                                                                *g:ag.lhandler*
A custom command used to open the location list after it's populated.
Default: "botright lopen". You might want to set this to change where the
location list is opened, or what size it is. Example: >
  let g:ag.lhandler="topleft lopen"
<

                                                                *g:ag.qhandler*
A custom command used to open the error list after it's populated. Default:
"botright copen". You might want to set this to change where the quickfix
window is opened, or what size it is. Example: >
  let g:ag.qhandler="copen 20"
                                                                *g:ag.nhandler*
A custom command used to open the AgGroup list after it's populated. Default:
"botright new". You might want to set this to change where it is opened.
Example: >
  let g:ag.nhandler="topleft new"
<

                                                         *g:ag.mapping_message*
Whether or not to show the message explaining the extra mappings that are
added to the results list this plugin populates. This message is not shown if
the mappings are not applied (see |g:ag.apply_qmappings| and
|g:ag.apply_lmappings| for more info. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:ag.mapping_message=0
<

                                                         *g:ag.goto_exact_line*
When navigate to file behind search, if there's context, |g:ag.goto_exact_line|
jumps to exact line selected, instead of matched line. Default 0. Example: >
  let g:ag.goto_exact_line=1
<

                                                     *g:ag.mappings_to_cmd_history*
Every search issued from shortcuts in normal or visual mode, is added to
history when |g:ag.mappings_to_cmd_history| is enabled. Default 0. Example: >

                                                     *g:ag.ignore_list*
Every search issued from shortcuts in normal or visual mode, is added to
history when |g:ag.mappings_to_cmd_history| is enabled. Default 0. Example: >
  let g:ag.mappings_to_cmd_history=1

ABBREVIATIONS                                                    *ag-abbrev*

In command line you can use *:cabbrev* restricted to the beginning of line,
which generally are much simpler to type. They expand into full commands on
any non-*'iskeyword'* characters like <Space>, <CR> or !.

General allowed formula:

    :\A*ag{lgr}{absfh}

    \A*         match any range/counter specifiers (:'<,'>  :.,.+2 :3: :21 )
    ag{lgr}     prefix for one of viewers (qflist, loclist, group, repeat)
    {absfh}     suffix of source (pwd, add, buffer, slash-reg, filelist, help)


Examples:

    :ag     -> :Ag
    :agfl   -> :LAgFile
    3: agr  -> :.,.+2 AgRepeat
    viw:agb -> :'<,'>AgBuffer
    :3 agg! -> :3 AgGroup!  (Alt: use ':' instead of space:  :3:agg)

    Note: space or colon delimiter between adjacent number and abbreviation
    is mandatory to trigger cabbrev instead of treating it as whole.
    (So :3ag<Space> don't work, because '3ag' is treated as single command)

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                         *ag-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

e                   open file and close the quickfix window.

o                   open file (same as enter).

go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on ag.vim results).

t                   open in a new tab.

T                   open in new tab silently.

h                   open in horizontal split.

H                  open in horizontal split silently.

v                   open in vertical split.

gv                  open in vertical split silently.

q                   close the quickfix window.
